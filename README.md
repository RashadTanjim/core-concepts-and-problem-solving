# Computer Science Fundamental Core Concepts and Problem-Solving

This repository is a curated collection of **core computer science concepts** and **algorithmic problem-solving techniques** implemented in Java, Go, Kotlin, Python, and C++. It is designed for learners and professionals aiming to strengthen their understanding of OOP, concurrency, software quality, and practical coding interview problems.

## 📌 Topics & Structure

### **Core Concepts**
- **Java & OOP**: JVM internals, memory management, garbage collection, class loading, generics, and type safety.
- **Go Best Practices**: Modules, project layout, error handling, concurrency patterns, and performance tips.
- **Concurrency**: Thread safety, synchronization, locks, thread pools, deadlocks, and race conditions.
- **SQA & Testing**: Testing fundamentals, QA concepts, and interview-style Q&A.

### **Problem Solving**
- **Algorithmic Challenges**: Well-documented Java solutions to common problems (e.g., LeetCode), such as Longest Common Subsequence.
